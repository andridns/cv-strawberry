# cv-strawberry

Image Processing project to detect strawberries using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) Computer Vision library.

## Files

To open the main code, simply open [`strawberry.ipynb`](strawberry.ipynb) on any desktop browser, or you can download and run the cells in a Python 2 environment. The code is presented in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) / iPython notebook for readability purposes.
